## Linear regression in TensorFlow

a) Open the notebook [Linreg_with_slider](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course/blob/master/notebooks/02_Linreg_with_sliderLinreg_with_slider.ipynb) and run the fist 4 cells and try to minimize the loss by adjusting the parameters a and b.

b) Run the next two cells and feed your adjusted parameters through the graph. You have to modify cell 6 a bit.

c) Now let TensorFlow optimize the parameters in cell 7. Modify cell 7 with the right feeding data.  
Hint: Look at the learning rate

d) Draw the linreg graph and compare your graph with the Tensorboard graph.
